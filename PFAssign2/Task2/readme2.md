i first initialised a counting array for ascii codes of characters and increased the count for the character of the same ascii value,

i used 2d arrray initialisation which was taught to us in the lab and using that logic i used it to go through the each letter

then printing count with value greater than 0 with k being its ascii code

this taught me that ascii codes are built in in C and u use just %d instead of %c to get the ascii code.
