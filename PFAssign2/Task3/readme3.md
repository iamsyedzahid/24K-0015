I checked whether 2nd letter is not same as the first one, and incremented i and keep checking until last index is not same as the previous one

i == 0 is to let first letter be stored,

word[i] != word[i-1] is to check the current letter with previous one.

result index is j++ which is post increment to record the output required.
